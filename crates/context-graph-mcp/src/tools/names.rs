//! Tool names as constants for dispatch matching.
//!
//! Per PRD v6 Section 10, these MCP tools should be exposed:
//! - Core: inject_context, search_graph, store_memory, get_memetic_status
//! - Topic: get_topic_portfolio, get_topic_stability, detect_topics, get_divergence_alerts
//! - Consolidation: trigger_consolidation
//! - Curation: merge_concepts, forget_concept, boost_importance
//!
//! Constants marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]` are defined for future handler
//! implementations. See registry.rs for handler registration status.
